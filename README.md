# Codex iMessage Handoff

iMessage Handoff lets you continue a local Codex thread from iMessage or via SMS. It has two parts:

- `imessage-handoff`: the installable Codex skill.
- `relay`: a relay that connects Codex with Messages through [Sendblue](https://sendblue.com) (use our hosted relay or deploy your own).
- `handoff`: the local reliability CLI for state, diagnostics, recovery, simulation, and dashboard workflows.

## Install

Install the skill from Codex:

```text
$skill-installer install https://github.com/iice257/codex-handoff-plus/tree/main/imessage-handoff
```

After installing, open a Codex thread and say:

```text
$imessage-handoff
```

On first use, Codex asks whether you want the hosted iMessage relay or your own relay, then asks permission to install the Codex Stop hook used to forward responses and wait for iMessage replies. Restart Codex once after the hook is installed.

If this is your first time, Codex prints a pairing code. Text that code to the phone number shown by Codex within 15 minutes. After that, text normal instructions from iMessage or SMS.

## How It Works

1. You choose the hosted relay or configure your own relay.
2. The skill asks permission to install the Codex Stop hook.
3. `$imessage-handoff` registers the current `CODEX_THREAD_ID` with the relay.
4. When you text the pairing code, the relay links that local token to your phone number.
5. The local Stop hook waits on a WebSocket connection to the relay.
6. When a message arrives from your paired phone, the relay wakes the waiting hook, the hook claims the message, and Codex continues the original thread.
7. For longer handoff tasks, Codex is prompted to send occasional short progress updates through the relay.
8. Codex results are forwarded through Sendblue, using iMessage when available and SMS fallback otherwise.

The local Stop hook maintains a WebSocket connection with the relay while it waits for iMessage input.

## Commands

Local Codex:

```text
$imessage-handoff
$imessage-handoff stop
```

Local CLI:

```bash
handoff init
handoff start
handoff stop
handoff status
handoff doctor
handoff repair
handoff logs
handoff transcript
handoff recover
handoff simulate inbound "what did I miss?"
handoff simulate failure webhook_timeout
handoff dashboard
handoff config get
handoff config set apiBaseUrl https://<your-worker-url>
handoff config profiles
handoff config use dry-run
handoff upgrade
```

Every CLI command supports `--json` for stable machine-readable output. The default runtime mode for real profiles is `confirm-send`; simulator and test profiles use `dry-run`.

iMessage:

```text
threads
```

`threads` shows active iMessage handoff threads and lets users switch which thread receives iMessage replies.

## Self-Hosting

See [relay](relay) for Cloudflare deployment instructions.

## Configure

Configure it by invoking the skill in Codex:

```text
$imessage-handoff show my config
$imessage-handoff use my self-hosted relay at https://<your-worker-url>
$imessage-handoff switch back to the hosted relay
$imessage-handoff reset my install token
$imessage-handoff remove hook
```

For the reliability CLI, profile config lives beside the skill state under `.state/plus/config.json`. Existing `.state/config.json` is migrated by:

```bash
handoff upgrade
```

See [docs/commands.md](docs/commands.md), [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md), and [docs/skill-reroute.md](docs/skill-reroute.md).

## Uninstall

Ask `$imessage-handoff remove hook`. This removes the Codex Stop hook used for communication with the relay. You can then disable or remove the skill in Codex settings.

## Security Model

iMessage Handoff is a relay for prompts into a local Codex thread. The local config contains the token that gets linked to your phone number when you pair with iMessage.

Keep `~/.codex/skills/imessage-handoff/.state/config.json` private. If that token leaks, reset the install token and pair your phone again:

```text
$imessage-handoff reset my install token
```

iMessage Handoff is designed to store the minimum data needed to route messages. The relay avoids persisting conversation content, avoids logging message details, and stores only routing metadata such as thread state, pairing state, and phone bindings.

User message content is held only briefly while waiting for local Codex to claim it, then it is scrubbed. Codex replies and generated images are forwarded to Sendblue, our iMessage sending provider, and are not stored by the relay. Aside from this transient relay processing, Sendblue is the only system intended to persist iMessage content.

For added security, Cloudflare persisted logging is disabled for the `imessage-handoff` relay so messages are not stored in Cloudflare logs.

The local `handoff` CLI writes a redacted JSONL event log for reliability diagnostics. Tokens, auth headers, API keys, webhook secrets, and phone numbers are redacted before they are displayed or written by the new local event layer.
